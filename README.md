# Text2Matra
Engineered a Text2Matra converter with Prof. Niraj Kumar Singh for poetic structure analysis in Python, processing over 10,000 words, which culminated in the establishment of India’s inaugural ”Centre of Excellence Lab”, thereby enriching the academic pursuits of over 1,000 scholars and researchers.

Coded 2 main functions:
1. Scansion Generator
2. Grouping the Scansions

# Scansion Generator
This aims to generate a scansion of the word/line/sentence based on specific rules of the Poetic Culture depending on the "Maatra weightage" which comes with a lot of edge cases and handling.

# Grouping the Scansions
This aims to group the scansions of the word in order to feed the machine so that it becomes easy and readable for the system to pronounce the poetic text in the way it is supposed to.

# File Handling
Got the oportunity to learn and work on python file handling, and also customised it to get the desired output in the way which is easier for the user to understand.

Worked on Hanuman Chalisa to produce Grouped Scansion of 1s and 2s.
Below is the image of the output being generated considering tons of edge cases.
